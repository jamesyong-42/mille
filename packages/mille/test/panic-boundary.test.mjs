// A native panic must reach JS as a catchable error, never as a dead process.
//
// mille loads into someone else's Electron main process. A panic that aborts
// takes their editor down with it — no error boundary, no crash report, no
// chance to flush unsaved buffers. Two independent things have to hold for a
// panic to be survivable, and each was broken in a different way:
//
//   1. The binary must be built with `panic = "unwind"`. `[profile.release]`
//      carried `panic = "abort"`, which turns every panic into SIGABRT before
//      any handler runs. Measured: sync AND async probes both exited 134.
//   2. Sync `#[napi]` entry points must opt into `catch_unwind`. Without it a
//      panic unwinds out of the generated `extern "C"` shim, which Rust
//      defines as an abort (`panic_cannot_unwind`). Measured: exit 134 even in
//      a debug build, where the profile already unwinds.
//
// The async path is worth probing separately because it fails differently:
// tokio catches panics in its own task machinery, so async entry points
// recovered cleanly in debug while dying in release. That divergence is the
// reason this test insists on running against the shipped profile in CI —
// a debug-only run would have called (2) fixed and missed (1) entirely.
//
// The probes are behind the `panic-probe` cargo feature and are absent from
// published artifacts. Build with `pnpm --filter @vibecook/mille
// build:napi:probe` (or `:release`) to exercise the behavioural half.
