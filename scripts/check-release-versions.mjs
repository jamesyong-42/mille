// Every publishable artifact in this repo ships under one version, and that
// version lives in roughly fifteen files. Release Please writes most of them
// from `release-please-config.json`; anything it does not know about silently
// rots until a release breaks `main`.
//
// That has now happened twice. `packages/mille-ui/src/index.ts` drifted three
// releases stale (see `packages/mille-ui/test/version-export.test.mjs`), and
// 0.3.1 shipped with `build-identity.test.mjs` still asserting '0.3.0' — red on
// `main` five minutes after the release PR merged.
//
// The durable fix is not to enumerate today's offenders in a test. It is to
// pick one file as the source of truth and compare every other location to it,
// so the expected value can never itself go stale:
//
//   packages/mille/package.json  ->  everything else
//
// A hardcoded '0.3.1' anywhere in this script would reintroduce exactly the bug
// it exists to catch. There is deliberately not one.
